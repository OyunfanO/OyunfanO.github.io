I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah, focusing on Machine Learning and Data Science. My faculty advisor is [Bao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_PTiDcoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Before joining the University of Utah, I was a postdoc researcher under the supervision of [Tieyong Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yyTgRwAAAAJ&hl=fr) in the Department of Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I was supervised by [Xue-cheng Tai](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=09Jag9sAAAAJ&hl=en).  

My areas of research interest encompass image processing, machine/deep learning, variational methods, and related fields in applied
mathematics. You can find my CV here: [Fan Jia's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_JIAFan.pdf).
