I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah. My faculty advisor is Bao Wang. 

I received my Ph.D. from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2021 under the supervision of Xue-cheng Tai.

My areas of research interest encompass image processing, machine/deep learning, variational methods, and related fields in applied
mathematics. You can find my CV here: [Fan Jia's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_JIAFan.pdf).
